# Password-Generator
Generates a random password
In Homework #3, we were asked to:

* create a randomly generated password based on user criteria

* user is asked what number of characters should be in the password from 8-128

* user is asked what types of characters should be included:
    * lower case letters
    * upper case letters
    * numbers
    * special characters

* based on user input, the program must then generate a random password using the length that the user entered.

## Description

* The user is asked for length of the password and what types of characters they want included.

* The length is checked to make sure it's between 8 and 128.  If it's not, the user is told what they entered and asked to enter again.

* If the user doesn't select at least one character set, they are told they need to select at least one and are asked the questions again.

* If the user selects Cancel when asked about the length, that round of generatePassword is ended.
